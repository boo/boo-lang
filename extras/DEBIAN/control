Description: Boo Programming Language
 Boo is an object-oriented statically-typed programming language
 for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) with a Python inspired
 syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility.
 This package includes the Boo libraries as well as a compiler (booc),
 an interpreter (booi) and an interactive shell (booish).
 The boo compiler and the programs it produces are 100% CIL and can be
 run on any compliant CLI virtual machine (MS.NET, Mono, ...).
